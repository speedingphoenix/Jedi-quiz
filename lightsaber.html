        If you got -10 to -5: Red. Unlike the Jedi, who wielded various colored
        lightsabers, the Sith all carried red lightsabers. It was a symbol of

        mysterious color lightsabers known in Star Wars. ... The shading purple
        speaks to moral uncertainty, reconstruction, and recovery. Therefore,
        the individuals that used a purple lightsaber generally shared an
        affinity with both the Light and Dark sides of the Force.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you got 2 - 4: Yellow. Yellow indicated a Jedi Sentinel, a Jedi who
        honed his or her skills in a balance of combat and scholarly pursuits.

        If you got 5 to 8: Blue. Blue indicated a Jedi Guardian, a Jedi who used
        the Force on a more physical level.

      <p>
        If you got 9 to 10: Green. Green indicated a Jedi Consular, a Jedi who
        preferred to reflect on the mysteries of the Force and fight the dark
        side at its heart.
