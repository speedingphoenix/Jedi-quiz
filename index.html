          An Introduction to jedi Lore
        </h2>
        <p>
          A Jedi was a devotee to the ways of the Jedi Order, an ancient order
          of protectors united by their ability to harness the power of the
          Force. Adhering to a doctrine that favored the light side of the
          Force, the Jedi aspired to attain a state of inner tranquility through
          calmness and meditation while avoiding emotions affiliated with the
          dark side of the Force, such as anger and hatred. Nevertheless, Jedi
          philosophy did not forbid a Jedi from acting in self-defense or in the
          defense of others. To that end, the weapon of a Jedi was the
          lightsaber, a blade composed of pure energy and different colors such
          as blue, green, purple or yellow. But if you lost your way and choose
          the dark side, than you have a red lightsaber.
